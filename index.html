                Welcome to my project. My name is George and I created this website to share my journey and what I am working towards. There is always something to work towards, whether it's in your professional, personal, or spiritual life. Right
                now, I am an aspiring software
                developer. To learn and improve my skills, I am currently working on a few projects to work on my development skills and just to gain some experience. The projects I have completed or currently working on is on my github and my
                project page.
                <br /><br />
                Down the line, I know there's going to be challenges along the way, but we all will face adversity. I tend to be public about it with those around me for a few reasons. First it's growing as a person. I need to remind myself that I'm
                just one person and I'm imperfect. I love difficulties and challenges as I think these moments are where I grow and learn the most. Second is to encourage other people. In my highest highs and lowest lows, I try to maintain a positive
                mindset. I do believe attitude is infectious so if I had a negative when I approach a problem, it'll either bring the mood down to those around me or others may think that's the right approach to solving a problem. Being positive in
                these situation allows me to focus my time on overcoming these challenges and set an example to others to overcome their challenges instead of dwelling in their problems.
                <br /> <br />
                I don't know where I or this site will be a month from now, but there's always a goal I'm moving towards and you'll see my progress, accomplishments, and failures here.
                <br /><br />
