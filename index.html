                Welcome to my project. My name is George and I created this website to share my journey. There is always something to work towards, whether it's in your professional, personal, or spiritual life. Right now, I am an aspiring software
                developer. To learn and improve my skills, I am currently working on a few projects to work on my development skills and just to gain some experience. The projects I have completed or currently working on is on my github. Even after I
                finish a project, I will keep looking for more projects to work on. The reason why is I don't enjoy being complacent is that I start easing up and won't feel like I need to continue to hustle. As I continue to move forward, I'll
                continue to show my progress here and we'll see where my project will take me.
