            One thing I really enjoy in my down time while commuting or waiting for friends to get ready...is doing sudoku puzzles. The first time I designed a sudoku puzzle solver was back in college when I had minimal programming experience. It was
            after my first semester learning java before I learned about objects. Also at the time, I didn't know how to test it properly so I had to manually import the puzzles each time. I decided to build the project again in python and found 9
            million test cases to work with.
            Due to file size being too big to store on github, I broke the files down to 200,000 lines each.
